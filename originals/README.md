This is a dump of the BBC BASIC (Z80) manual, each html page transformed into adoc format. 

The headers and footers have been removed from each individual pagei because otherwise ebook (EPUB, PDF) output repeats each at the head and foot of each section which is offputting. The copyright from the footer has been placed in its own adoc file. This and the header information will need to be combined with the rest of the files in the process of transforming them into the desired output (HTML, EPUB, PDF).
