== Operating System Interface

=== [#introduction]#Introduction#

As with the BBC micro computer, the star (*) commands provide access to the operating system. Since the BBC operating system is completely different to CP/M-80 there are a number of differences in the star commands.

==== [#specifiers]#File Specifiers#

File specifiers must comply with the standard CP/M-80 conventions.

____
....
[drive:]filename.extension
....

[cols=",",]
|===
|`drive:` |The single letter name (A to P) of the drive where the file will be found. The colon is mandatory. If the drive name is omitted, the currently logged-on drive is assumed.
|`filename` |The name of the file. The length of the name must not exceed 8 characters.
|`extension` |The optional extension of the file. If an extension is used it must be separated from the filename by a full-stop. If the extension is omitted, .BBC is assumed.
|===
____

Drives A: to P: are accepted in file specifications. Filenames in star commands may optionally be enclosed in quotes; unmatched quotes will cause a 'link:annexc.html#badstring[Bad string]' error. The standard CP/M-80 'wild-cards' may be used when an ambiguous file specifier is acceptable.

____
[cols=",",]
|===
|`?        ` |Allow any single character in this position. If this is used as the last character in the name, a null character will be accepted.
|`*` |Allow any character (including a null) from the position of the '*' to the end of the name or extension.
|===
____

==== [#symbols]#Symbols#

The following symbols and abbreviations are used as part of the explanation of the operating system commands.

[cols=",",]
|===
|\{} |The enclosed items may be repeated 0 or more times.
|[] |The items enclosed are optional, they may occur zero or one time.
|num |A numeric constant.
|str |A string constant.
|<num>    |A numeric variable.
|<str> |A string variable.
|afsp |An ambiguous file specifier.
|ufsp |An unambiguous file specifier.
|d: |A disk drive name.
|dir |A directory name.
|===

'''''

=== [#accessing]#Accessing Star Commands#

The star commands may be accessed directly or via the link:bbckey3.html#oscli[OSCLI] statement. The two examples below both access the link:opsys1.html#bye[BYE] command.

____
....
*BYE

OSCLI("BYE")
....
____

==== [#syntax]#Syntax#

A star command must be the last (or only) command on a program line and its argument may not be a variable. If you need to use one of these commands with a variable as the argument, use the link:bbckey3.html#oscli[OSCLI] statement. Examples of the use of the OSCLI statement are given below in the link:opsys1.html[Resident Star Commands] sub-section.

==== [#case]#Case Conversion#

Star commands and their associated qualifiers are converted from lower-case to upper-case if necessary. For example, *era wombat is converted to *ERA WOMBAT. This is in keeping with the general CP/M-80 philosophy and the BBC Micro's machine operating system (MOS).

==== [#special]#Special Characters#

Control characters, lower-case characters, DEL and quotation marks may be incorporated in filenames by using the 'escape' character '|'.

____
[cols=",",]
|===
||A   |gives ^A.
||a |gives lower-case A.
||? |gives Del.
||" |gives the quote marks ".
||| |gives the escape character |.
||! |sets bit 7 of the following character.
|===
____
