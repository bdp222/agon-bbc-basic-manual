== [#next]#NEXT#, N.

The statement delimiting link:bbckey2.html#for[FOR]...NEXT loops. NEXT takes an optional control variable.

[source,console]
----
NEXT
NEXT J
----

If the control variable is present then FOR----NEXT loops may be 'popped' automatically in an attempt to match the correct link:bbckey2.html#for[FOR] statement (this should not be necessary). If a matching FOR statement cannot be found, a 'link:annexc.html#cantmatchfor[Can't match FOR]' error will be reported.

Leaving out the control variable will make the program run quicker, but this is not to be encouraged.

See the keyword link:bbckey2.html#for[FOR] for more details about the structure of FOR----NEXT loops.
