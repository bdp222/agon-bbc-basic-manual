== [#str]#STR$#

A string function which returns the string form of the numeric argument as it would have been printed.

If the most significant byte of @% is not zero, STR$ uses the current @% description when generating the string. If it is zero (the initial value) then the G9 format (see link:bbckey3.html#print[PRINT]) is used.

If STR$ is followed by ~ (tilde) then a hexadecimal conversion is carried out.
