== [#ln]#LN#

A function giving the natural logarithm of its argument.

[source,console]
----
X=LN(Y)

This function gives the logarithm to the base 'e' of its argument. The 'natural' number, 'e', is approximately 2.71828183.

Logarithms are 'traditionally' used for multiplication (by adding the logarithms) and division (by subtracting the logarithms). For example,

[source,console]
----
10 log1=LN(2.5)
20 log2=LN(2)
30 log3=log1+log2
40 answer=EXP(log3)
50 PRINT answer
----

will calculate 2.5*2 by adding their natural logarithms and print the answer.
