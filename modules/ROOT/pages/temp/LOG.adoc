== [#log]#LOG#

A function giving the base-10 logarithm of its argument.

[source,console]
----
X = LOG(Y)
----

This function calculates the common (base 10) logarithm of its argument. Inverse logarithms (anti-logs) can be calculated by raising 10 to the power of the logarithm. For example, if `x=LOG(y)` then `y=10^x`.

Logarithms are 'traditionally' used for multiplication (by adding the logarithms) and division (by subtracting the logarithms). For example,

[source,console]
----
10 log1=LOG(2.5)
20 log2=LOG(2)
30 log3=log1+log2
40 answer=10^log3
50 PRINT answer
