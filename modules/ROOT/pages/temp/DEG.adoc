== [#deg]#DEG#

A function which converts radians to degrees.

[source,console]
----
degree_angle=DEG(PI/2)
X=DEG(ATN(1))
----

You can use this function to convert an angle expressed in radians to degrees. One radian is approximately 57 degrees (actually 180/PI). PI/2 radians is 90 degrees and link:bbckey3.html#pi[PI] radians is 180 degrees.

Using DEG is equivalent to multiplying the radian value by 180/PI, but the result is calculated internally to a greater accuracy.

See link:#acs[ACS], link:#asn[ASN] and link:#atn[ATN] for further examples of the use of DEG.
