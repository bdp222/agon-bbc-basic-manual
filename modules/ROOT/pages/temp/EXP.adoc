This function can be used as the 'anti-log' of a natural logarithm. Logarithms are 'traditionally' used for multiplication (by adding the logarithms) and division (by subtracting the logarithms). For example,

[source,console]
----
10 log1=LN(2.5)
20 log2=LN(2)
30 log3=log1+log2
40 answer=EXP(log3)
50 PRINT answer
----

will calculate 2.5*2 by adding their natural logarithms and print the answer.
