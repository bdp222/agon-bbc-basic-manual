== [#sin]#SIN#

A function giving the sine of its radian argument.

[source,console]
----
X=SIN(Y)
----

This function returns the sine of an angle. The angle must be expressed in radians, not degrees.

Whilst the computer is quite happy dealing with angles expressed in radians, you may prefer to express angles in degrees. You can use the link:#rad[RAD] function to convert an angle from degrees to radians.

The example below sets Y to the sine of the angle 'degree_angle' expressed in degrees.

[source,console]
----
Y=SIN(RAD(degree_angle))
