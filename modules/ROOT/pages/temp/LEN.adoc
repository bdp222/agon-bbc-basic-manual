== [#len]#LEN#

A function which returns the length of the argument string.

[source,console]
----
X=LEN"fred"
X=LENA$
X=LEN(A$+B$)
----

This function 'counts' the number of characters in a string. For example,

[source,console]
----
length=LEN("BBC BASIC (Z80)   ")
----

would set 'length' to 15 since the string consists of the 12 characters of BBC BASIC (Z80) followed by three spaces.

LEN is often used with a link:#for[FOR]----link:bbckey3.html#next[NEXT] loop to 'work down' a string doing something with each letter in the string. For example, the following program looks at each character in a string and checks that it is a valid hexadecimal numeric character.

 [source,console]
----
10 valid$="0123456789ABCDEF"
 20 REPEAT
 30   INPUT "Type in a HEX number" hex$
 40   flag=TRUE
 50   FOR i=1 TO LEN(hex$)
 60     IF INSTR(valid$,MID$(hex$,i,1))=0 flag=FALSE
 80   NEXT
 90   IF NOT flag THEN PRINT "Bad HEX"
100 UNTIL flag
