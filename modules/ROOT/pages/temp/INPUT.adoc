== [#inputhash]#INPUT##

A statement which reads data in internal format from a file and puts them in the specified variables. INPUT# is normally used with a file or device opened with link:bbckey3.html#openin[OPENIN], link:bbckey3.html#openup[OPENUP] or link:bbckey3.html#openout[OPENOUT], but may alternatively be used with the AUX device (usually a serial port) which has the 'permanently open' handle = 3.

It is possible to read past the end-of-file without an error being reported. You should always include some form of check for the end of the file.

link:bbckey4.html#readhash[READ#] can be used as an alternative to INPUT#.

See the link:bbcfile1.html[Disk Files] section for more details and numerous examples of the use of INPUT#.
