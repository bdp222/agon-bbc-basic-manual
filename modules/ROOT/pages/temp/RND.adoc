If n is negative the pseudo random sequence generator is set to a number based on n and n is returned.

If n is 0 the last random number is returned in RND(1) format.

The random number generator is initialised by link:#run[RUN] (or link:bbckey1.html#chaim[CHAIN]). Consequently, RND will return zero until the RUN (or CHAIN) command is first issued.
