== [#restore]#RESTORE#, RES.

RESTORE can be used at any time in a program to set the line where link:bbckey1.html#data[DATA] is read from.

RESTORE on its own resets the data pointer to the first data item in the program.

RESTORE followed by a parameter sets the data pointer to the first item of data in the specified line (or the next line containing a DATA statement if the specified line does not contain data). This optional parameter for RESTORE can specify a calculated line number.
