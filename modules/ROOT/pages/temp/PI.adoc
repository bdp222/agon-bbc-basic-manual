You can use PI to calculate the circumference and area of a circle. The example below calculates the circumference and area of a circle of a given radius.

[source,console]
----
10 CLS
20 INPUT "What is the radius of the circle ",rad
30 PRINT "The circumference is: ";2*PI*rad
40 PRINT "The area is: ";PI*rad*rad
50 END
----

PI can also be used to convert degrees to radians and radians to degrees.

[source,console]
----
radians=PI/180*degrees
degrees=180/PI*radians
----

However, BBC BASIC (Z80) has two functions (link:bbckey4.html#rad[RAD] and link:bbckey1.html#deg[DEG]) which perform these conversions to a higher accuracy.
