== [#atn]#ATN#

A function giving the arc tangent of its argument in radians. The permitted range of the argument is from - to + infinity.

By convention, the result will be in the range -PI/2 to +PI/2 (-90 to +90 degrees).

If you know the tangent of the angle, this function will tell you the angle (in radians).

As the magnitude of the argument (tangent) becomes very large (approaches + or - infinity) the accuracy diminishes.

In the example below, 'radian_angle' becomes equal to the angle (in radians) whose tangent is 'y'.

radian_angle=ATN(y)

You can convert the answer to degrees by using the link:#deg[DEG] function. (The DEG function is equivalent to multiplying by 180/PI.) The example below is similar to the first one, but the angle is in degrees.

[source,console]
----
degree_angle=DEG(ATN(y))
