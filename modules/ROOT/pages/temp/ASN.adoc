== [#asn]#ASN#

A function giving the arc sine of its argument in radians. The permitted range of the argument is -1 to +1.

By convention, the result will be in the range -PI/2 to +PI/2 (-90 to +90 degrees).

If you know the sine of the angle, this function will tell you the angle (in radians). Unfortunately, you cannot do this with complete certainty because one sine has two associated angles. (See link:#acs[ACS] for details.)

In the example below, 'radian_angle' becomes equal to the angle (in radians) whose sine is 'y'.

[source,console]
----
radian_angle=ASN(y)

You can convert the answer to degrees by using the link:#deg[DEG] function. (The DEG function is equivalent to multiplying by 180/PI.) The example below is similar to the first one, but the angle is in degrees.

[source,console]
----
degree_angle=DEG(ASN(y))
