== [#let]#LET#

LET is an optional assignment statement.

LET is not permitted in the assignment of the pseudo-variables link:#lomem[LOMEM], link:#himem[HIMEM], link:bbckey3.html#page[PAGE], link:bbckey4.html#ptr[PTR#] and link:bbckey4.html#time[TIME].

LET was mandatory in early versions of BASIC. Its use emphasised that when we write

[source,console]
----
X=X+4
----

we don't mean to state that X equals X+4 - it can't be, but rather 'let X become equal to what it was plus 4':

[source,console]
----
LET X=X+4
----

Most modern versions of BASIC allow you to drop the 'LET' statement. However, if you are writing a program for a novice, the use of LET makes it more understandable.
