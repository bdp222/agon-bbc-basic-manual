== [#val]#VAL#

A function which converts a character string representing a number into numeric form.

[source,console]
----
X=VAL(A$)
----

VAL makes the best sense it can of its argument. If the argument starts with numeric characters (with or without a preceding sign), VAL will work from left to right until it meets a non numeric character. It will then 'give up' and return what it has got so far. If it can't make any sense of its argument, it returns zero.

For example,

[source,console]
----
PRINT VAL("-123.45.67ABC")
----

would print

[source,console]
----
-123.45
----

and

[source,console]
----
PRINT VAL("A+123.45")
----

would print

[source,console]
----
0
----

VAL will NOT work with hexadecimal numbers. You must use link:bbckey2.html#eval[EVAL] to convert hexadecimal number strings.
