== [#lomem]#LOMEM#

Normally, dynamic variables are stored in memory immediately after your program. (See the Annex entitled link:annexd.html[Format of Program and Variables in Memory].) You can change the address where BBC BASIC (Z80) starts to store these variables by changing LOMEM.

USE WITH CARE. Changing LOMEM in the middle of a program causes BBC BASIC (Z80) to lose track of all the variables you are using.
