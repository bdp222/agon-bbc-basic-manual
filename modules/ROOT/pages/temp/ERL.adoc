== [#erl]#ERL#

A function returning the line number of the line where the last error occurred.

[source,console]

X=ERL

If there was an error in a procedure call, the line number of the calling line would be returned, not the line number of the definition.

The number returned by ERL is the line number printed out when BBC BASIC (Z80) reports an error.

See the link:bbc2.html#errorhandling[Error Handling] sub-section for more information on error handling and correction.
