== [#mode]#MODE#, MO.

The MODE command sets the screen display mode. The screen is cleared and all the graphics and text parameters (colours, origin, etc) are reset to their default values.

The modes differ from those on the BBC series of microcomputers.

From MOS 1.03, they are as follows:

* 0: 1024 x 768 @ 60Hz, 2 colours per pixel
* 1: 512 x 384 @ 60Hz, 16 colours per pixel
* 2: 320 x 200 @ 75Hz, 64 colours per pixel
* 3: 640 x 480 @ 60Hz, 16 colours per pixel

Modes with less than 64 colours per pixel are paletted; each logical colour can be assigned a different physical colour. See the COLOUR statement below for more information.
