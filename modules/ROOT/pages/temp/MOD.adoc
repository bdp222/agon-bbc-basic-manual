== [#mod]#MOD#

A binary operation giving the signed remainder of the integer division.

[source,console]
----
X=A MOD B

MOD is defined such that,

[source,console]
----
A MOD B = A - ( A DIV B ) * B.

If you are doing integer division (link:bbckey1.html#div[DIV]) of whole numbers it is often desirable to know the remainder. (A 'teach children to divide' program for instance.) For example, 23 divided by 3 is 7, remainder 2. Thus,

[source,console]
----
10 PRINT 23 DIV 3
20 PRINT 23 MOD 3
----

would print

         [source,console]
----
7
2
----

You can use real numbers in these calculations, but they are truncated to their integer part before BBC BASIC (Z80) calculates the result. Thus,

[source,console]
----
10 PRINT 23.1 DIV 3.9
20 PRINT 23.1 MOD 3.9
----

would give exactly the same results as the previous example.
