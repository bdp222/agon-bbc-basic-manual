== [#report]#REPORT#

A statement which prints out the error string associated with the last error which occurred.

You can use this statement within your own error handling routines to print out an error message for those errors you are not able to cope with.

The example below is an error handling routine designed to cope only with the <ESCAPE> key being pressed. All other errors are reported and the program terminated.

[source,console]

  10 ON ERROR GOTO 1000

 980 END
 990 :
1000 PRINT
1010 IF ERR=17 THEN PRINT "<ESCAPE> ignored":GOTO 20
1020 REPORT:PRINT " at line ";ERL
