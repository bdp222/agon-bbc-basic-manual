BBC BASIC (Z80) does not have true Boolean variables. Instead, numeric variables are used and their value is interpreted in a 'logical' manner. A value of 0 is interpreted as false and NOT link:bbckey2.html#false[FALSE] (in other words, NOT 0 (= -1)) is interpreted as TRUE.

In practice, any value other than zero is considered TRUE. This can lead to confusion; see the keyword link:bbckey3.html#not[NOT] for details.

See the link:bbc2.html#boolean[Variables] sub-section for more details on Boolean variables and the keyword link:bbckey1.html#and[AND] for logical tests and their results.
